# esb-node
This is starting out as a fork of this [repo](https://github.com/a7ul/esbuild-node-tsc)
But because they don't think bundle in node.js should be allowed, I had to fork it.
I plan to make a few other changes, so I just made it it's own repo.
But, as of right now, the repo is the same except it gives you full access to the esbuild config.
For more information see the [Readme in the parent repo](https://github.com/a7ul/esbuild-node-tsc)
